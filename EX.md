challenge survivor 
one every 3 is eliminated until one remains 
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7] - initial sequence 
[1,2,4,5,6,7] => 3 is counted out [
  1,2,4,5,7] => 6 is counted out 
  [1,4,5,7] => 2 is counted out 
  [1,4,5] => 7 is counted out 
  [1,4] => 5 is counted out 
  [4] => 1 counted out, 
  4 is the last element - the survivor!

challenge number salad 
given [1, 10, 30,50, 200, 30, 10] from the first two numbers substract the smaller from the bigger 10 - 1 
then we have [9, 30, 50, 200, 30, 10] 30 - 9 
[21, 50, 200, 30, 10] 50 - 21 
[29, 200, 30, 10] 200 - 29 
[71, 30, 10] 71 - 30 
[41, 10] 41 - 10 
[31]
